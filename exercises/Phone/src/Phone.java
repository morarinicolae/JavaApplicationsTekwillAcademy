3.	Write a program for Horizon Phones, a provider of cellular phone service. 
Prompt a user for maximum monthly values for talk minutes used, text messages sent,
and gigabytes of data used, and then recommend the best plan for the customerâ€™s needs.
A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and no text or data should accept Plan A at $49 per month. 
A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and any text messages should accept Plan B at $55 per month.
A customer who needs 500 or more minutes of talk and no data should accept 
either Plan C for up to 100 text messages at $61 per month or Plan D for 100 text
messages or more at $70 per month. A customer who needs any data should accept 
Plan E for up to 2 gigabytes at $79 or Plan F for 2 gigabytes or more at $87
