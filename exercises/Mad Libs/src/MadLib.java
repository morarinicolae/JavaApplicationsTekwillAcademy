/*6.Mad Libs is a childrenâ€™s game in which they provide a few words that are then incorporated into a silly story. The game helps children understand different parts of speech because they are asked to provide specific types of words. For example,you might ask a child for a noun, another noun, an adjective, and a past-tense verb. The child might reply with such answers as table, book, silly, and studied. The newly created Mad Lib might be:
Mary had a little table
Its book was silly as snow
And everywhere that Mary studied
The table was sure to go.*/
